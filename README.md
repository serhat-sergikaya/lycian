# About the project
 
 **LYCIAN** is developed to test my css skils therefore there is no functionality except market the section.
 The website is connected to [CoinGecko API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). TMDB provides data for movies and series including their details such as cast members, production companies etc.
 It also allows to add query parameters to narrow down the search.
 React Query is used for API calls, Zustand for Global State Management and React Router for navigation.
