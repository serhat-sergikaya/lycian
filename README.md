# About the project
 
 **LYCIAN** is developed to test my css skils therefore there is no functionality except market the section.
 The website is connected to [CoinGecko API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). CoinGecko provides realtime data for crypto currencies.
 It also allows to add query parameters to narrow down the search.
 React Query is used for API calls and caching.
